222222	22222	0375831002	5	I don't think I will ever read a book that has such an impact on me as this one has. I truly adore this book more and more each time I read it. If I had to pick one book out of the hundreds I've read to be my favourite, this one would definitely be it.
333333	33333	0545010225	5	This was a reread for me (obviously) and it was so heartwarming and perfect. Rereading Harry Potter is like coming home. I listened to it on audio because Jim Dale is bae. Seriously, his Hagrid voice is my life.
444444	44444	0739346806	4	Amazing, I loved it! Not a super fast-paced book, but such with a creepy, twisted, disturbing, awesome vibe throughout it all that makes you want to read (in my case, listen) and do nothing else. The twist at the end was incredible, wow! I want more.
555555	55555	0307588378	5	So addicting. So full of twists and turns that you just cannot stop reading, you want to know more, you hope your morning commute would be longer so you could read more. The entire storyline was so well crafted (if you read the book you know what I'm talking about).
